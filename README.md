## Ahoy :wave:

I am an Open Source enthusiast :penguin: and sci-fi nerd :rocket: from [Rahden, Germany](https://goo.gl/maps/4LMmDoK9PFNk7Q3G6). At [@mittwald](https://github.com/mittwald), I build and architect cloud platforms with Kubernetes and also build the software that runs on them. I also teach Software Development and Cloud Computing courses at the [PHWT in Vechta](https://phwt.de). In my spare time, I develop and maintain a diverse set of open source libraries and tools. When I find the time, I also write (and [speak](https://speakerdeck.com/martinhelmich)) about my work and various Open Source projects (both [digitally](https://www.martin-helmich.de/en/blog.html) and [old school, on paper](https://www.martin-helmich.de/en/publications.html)).

### :european_castle: Some projects 

Most of my pet projects were born out of [some itch that needed scratching](http://www.catb.org/~esr/writings/cathedral-bazaar/cathedral-bazaar/index.html).

- **You like running stuff on Kubernetes?** Me, too! A while ago, I implemented [a Kubernetes-native SMTP server](https://github.com/martin-helmich/kube-mail) (still very much a prototype, though) and also provided a small example on [how to build your own client for Kubernetes custom resources](https://github.com/martin-helmich/kubernetes-crd-example) (accompanied by a [blog article](https://www.martin-helmich.de/en/blog/kubernetes-crd-client.html)). I also manage some of my employer's Kubernetes-related projects, like [a Varnish integration for Kubernetes](https://github.com/mittwald/kube-httpcache) or a [controller for replicating secrets](https://github.com/mittwald/kubernetes-secret-replicator).
- **DevOps?** Yes, please. One of my more active projects is a [Prometheus exporter](https://github.com/martin-helmich/prometheus-nginxlog-exporter) for generating performance metrics from NGINX access logs (or compatible).
- Because I started my career in web development, I also have some ties to the TYPO3 and PHP communities. To enable an painless quickstart with TYPO3, I implemented an easy-to-use [TYPO3 Docker image](https://github.com/martin-helmich/docker-typo3) and also built a [little tool to ensure code quality](https://github.com/martin-helmich/typo3-typoscript-lint) in TYPO3 projects.
- Speaking of PHP, I have multiple PHP libraries published [on Packagist](https://packagist.org/packages/helmich/) that I develop and maintain.
